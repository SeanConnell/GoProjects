Circulating Modafinil Calculator!
Figure out how much you have in your system right now, and how long you'll
need to wait to get back to a normal level. 
What you'll do with this information, I have no idea!

Assumptions: 
    An intravenous route of administration (mostly because I don't have a good model for oral -- yet)
    A constant dosage
    A ~consistent timing interval for dosages
    A linear superposition for dosages (eg secretion isn't related to concentration) 
    A half life of 13.5 hours, which is the average of the range given for modafinil of 12-15 hours
*/

//TODO Add these features maybe?
//Calc peak/trough variation in steady state dose withing timing 
//Calc time until under certain value of mass
